|----------|----------|
| 1 | Urgent medical needs |

| 4 | Short-notice availability |

Flag patients with special needs or accommodations

#### Step 3: When a Slot Opens
- Review waitlist immediately
- Match appointment type and duration
- Verify provider matches patient need

- Be honest about wait times

#### Step 6: Assess Appropriateness
Consider:
- Is this a true medical urgency?
- Can it be handled via phone triage or telehealth?
- Is urgent care/ER more appropriate?
- Is this an established patient?
- Will adding significantly delay others?

#### Step 7: Approve or Decline
- If approved: Add to schedule, inform clinical team, set wait expectations
- If declined: "We're fully booked, but I have [next available]"
- Offer waitlist or next appointment
- Provide alternatives if urgent (urgent care, ER)
